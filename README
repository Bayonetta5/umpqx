umpqx MPQ extraction utility
============================

umpqx is a simple command-line MPQ extraction utility.
It also features the ability to reconstruct MPQ's.
As far as I know, umpqx is the only free MPQ extractor that can rebuild the listfile.
See MPQ Recover and RMPQEx for similar non-free tools.

The official umpqx webpage is at:

Installation
------------
You will need the StormLib MPQ library to use umpqx.
If you don't have this already, you can compile on Linux with
	cd umpqx_path/StormLib
	mv Makefile.linux Makefile
	make && make install

On Windows, download Visual C++ 2008, open the umpqx_path/StormLib/StormLib.sln file.
Then, compile the solution.
Once that is done, move the created StormLib.dll and StormLib.lib to umpqx_path/
	(the .dll and .lib should be located in umpqx_path/StormLib/bin/StormLib_dll/.../)
Now, open umpqx.sln, and compile.

Compile umpqx with the included script on Linux platforms:
	./compile.sh

On Windows, open umpqx.sln in Visual C++, and compile.

Special Windows instructions
----------------------------

In the rest of this README, "./umpqx" should be replaced with "umpqx.exe" if using Windows.

Also, to run umpqx, open Command Prompt (Start -> type cmd -> select Command Prompt).
Then use cd to change directory to wherever umpqx is located.
And then copy the options below, replacing like stated above.

Command-line arguments
----------------------

umpqx should be run like:
	./umpqx [options] [listfile1 listfile2 ...] MPQ file

Options (options are space-separated, cannot be combined with one dash):
	-w working_directory: use working_directory as the working directory (default is "working")
	-d: enable debug mode
	-c: create a new MPQ file from the files in working directory (instead of extracting)
	
	-search: if extracting, search for extra files that are not in listfile
	-now: if extracting, disable actually writing to files (this can be useful if using -av)
	-av: if extracting, enables antivirus to search for exploits in map
	-w3mmd: if extracting, add W3MMD code to the war3map.j JASS script
	
	-compact: if creating, compacts MPQ after adding files is completed
	-compress: if creating, compresses files as they are added using StormLib's MPQ_COMPRESSION_ZLIB option
	-header mpq_source: if creating, prepends header from an external MPQ to the generated one

Note: if no listfiles are specified, the default "listfile.txt" is used.

Usage
-----

First, you probably would want to extract files from a map:
	./umpqx -w map_files/ map.w3x

Use the search option if the list file is incomplete (for protected maps):
	./umpqx -w map_files/ -search map.w3x

You may also want to detect exploits in the map as you extract:
	./umpqx -w map_files/ -search -av map.w3x

If you just want the exploit detection, better to speed it up with a shorter listfile and no file search:
	./umpqx -w map_files/ -now -av listfile_fast.txt map.w3x

Once you're done editing whatever files you want to, you create an MPQ with:
	./umpqx -w map_files/ -c reconstructed.mpq

Unfortunately, this MPQ file is not loadable by Warcraft III.
To make it playable, you need to copy the 512-byte header from the original map:
	./umpqx -w map_files/ -header map.w3x -c map_new.w3x

Now, map_new.w3x can be copied to your Maps folder and can be played.
But, it'll probably be much larger than the original map because compression is disabled by default.
To solve this:
	./umpqx -w map_files/ -header map.w3x -compress -compact -c map_new.w3x

This will enable both compression and compacting.
